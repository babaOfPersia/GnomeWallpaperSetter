# Gnome Wallpaper Setter

### An effortless wallpaper downloader setter application


The Linux Wallpaper Changer is a Python script designed to download and set wallpapers for Linux devices. It uses the Unsplash API (for now) to fetch high-quality images from the user specified image collection.

The script is intended to be run in the background and automatically change the wallpaper every week.
## Acknowledgements

 - This app uses the Unsplash API for now. However, there is a plan to allow users to download wallpapers from any other API soon.
